Title: Exploring News Sentiment and Societal Well-being: An Analysis Using Neural Networks

Abstract:
Understanding the influence of news sentiment on individuals' emotions and overall societal well-being is a crucial area of research. In this study, we propose an approach that leverages neural networks for sentiment analysis of news articles. By training and evaluating various neural network architectures, we aim to classify news articles as positive or negative, providing users with valuable insights for informed news consumption. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between news sentiment and societal outcomes using longitudinal data from web archives.

Introduction:
The media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion and affecting individuals' emotional states. The sentiment conveyed in news articles can significantly impact individuals' well-being and societal dynamics. This study focuses on utilizing neural networks to perform sentiment analysis on news articles, enabling a deeper understanding of the relationship between news sentiment and societal well-being.

Methods:
We employ neural network architecture , for sentiment analysis on news articles. Each architecture is trained and evaluated on a labeled dataset of news articles, employing appropriate preprocessing techniques like tokenization and embedding. Web archives are utilized to collect longitudinal data for analyzing sentiment trends over time.

Results:
The performance of the different neural network architectures in sentiment analysis is assessed based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Results indicate that the neural networks demonstrate promising capabilities in classifying news articles as positive or negative. The evaluation reveals the strengths and limitations of each architecture, providing insights into their suitability for news sentiment analysis.

Discussion:
The utilization of neural networks for sentiment analysis empowers users to make informed decisions about their news consumption, enabling them to regulate their emotional well-being effectively. Furthermore, the longitudinal analysis of news sentiment trends over time offers valuable insights into the changing landscape of news sentiment and its potential implications for societal well-being.

Conclusion:
This study showcases the effectiveness of employing various neural network architectures for sentiment analysis of news articles. The findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between news sentiment and societal outcomes. The application of neural networks in news sentiment analysis provides users with valuable tools for informed news consumption, while the longitudinal analysis sheds light on the dynamic nature of news sentiment. These insights aid in fostering a more balanced and informed society.
